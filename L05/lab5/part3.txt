1. Why are all the reported times zero? the code calls the kernel or libraries not compiled with -pg
2. Why is factors_itr only called once every time the program is run? because factors_itr calls other functions to perform other commands
3. Is there an obvious mathematical relationship between the input number and the number of recursive calls? What about the number of prime factors each number produces? there is a relationship between the number of recursive calls and the prime numbers that are produced
